# Predicting Tree Growth Using 5 Million ðŸŒ´ Across the US


## Overview

This project aims to predict tree growth using a dataset comprising over 5 million trees across the United States. By applying machine learning techniques, we seek to analyse various factors influencing tree growth and make accurate predictions that could benefit tree-related overhead powerline faults management, forestry management, and maybe ecological research ðŸ˜Ž.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes data from 5 million trees in the US, covering various features such as species, age, location, and environmental conditions.

#### Data Column Descriptions
